# K-means
A python implementation of k-means clustering algorithm.
### Input
1. A list of points in the plane where each point is represented by a latitude/longitude pair.
2. The number of centroids
3. The max_number of iterations
4. The condition of convergence
### Output
- The final clusters of points.
- An image to make the result clear.
- Optional, the loss or clusters of points after each iteration
### Technical details
The distance of two points in the code use the euclidean metric, you can also use other method as you like.
You may have to modify the get_data code that data format in file may different, or you can modify the format of points just like me.
